The Xtreme firmware is firmware oriented to update the system with the latest and most popular applications. This is why it has become so popular nowadays. In this post we will see how to install this software in our Flipper Zero.

First of all, you will need to install the official Zero flipper installer "qFlipper" from the [Flipper Zero Website](https://flipperzero.one/downloads).
It will also be necessary to download the latest firmware version "Xtreme Firmware". To do this, you will need to download the ".tar" file of the latest release from the [Xtreme-Firmware Github Repository](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware/releases).

After that we connect the flipper zero to the computer and open the qFlipper application. Then, from the Flipper Zero application, click on the "Install from file" button and select the downloaded ".tar" file.
