  abstract={Platform conceived as a control center that allows to emergency services (Civil Protection, State Security Forces, etc.) to manage the information sent through their accounts in media such as social networks and provide in an orderly and categorized manner all information. The information may be monitored and will allow the provision of public information such as protocols (in various multimedia formats such as PDF, images, etc.) in emergency situations, which facilitate access to it and direct communication with population. In addition, the information on emergencies will be geolocated according to its geographical scope of application and/or generalized for other possible emergency cases, available on the platform. The generation of QR codes with this information will facilitate and speed up access to all the required data in each possible situation of each possible place, being easily located anywhere. The normal (civil) user will be allowed to interact with the platform, being able to generate their own QR, grouping useful information if they know the terrain or any critical area. The platform will also have to cover the maximum number of people possible, including those who do not use social networks, a section with the latest emergencies that have occurred and a browser to find the desired information using search criteria and keywords.},
